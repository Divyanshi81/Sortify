# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the **Sorting Visualizer!** 🎉  
This is an interactive web app I built to better understand how different sorting algorithms work — and to make learning them fun and visual.

Built with **React**, this tool lets you watch sorting algorithms in action. You can explore how popular methods like **Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort** organize data, step by step.

## ✨ What this project does
- **Shows sorting in real time:** Watch colorful bars move, compare, and swap as the algorithms do their work.
- **Explains the process:** Each algorithm is paired with simple explanations, so you not only see *what* happens but also *why*.
- **Makes learning easier:** Whether you're just starting with algorithms or want to refresh your memory, these animations help you grasp the logic behind each method.

## 🚀 Why I built this
I created this project to deepen my own understanding of sorting algorithms and to build something that could also help others learn. Seeing the steps play out visually is often the best way to really “get it.”

## 📚 Sorting algorithms included
- **Merge Sort:** See how it breaks the array into halves and merges them back in order.
- **Quick Sort:** Watch how it picks pivot elements to partition the array efficiently.
- **Heap Sort:** Understand how a binary heap is formed and sorted.
- **Bubble Sort:** Follow this classic, straightforward (but less efficient) method.

---

## 🌐 What you can learn
- The core ideas behind each algorithm
- How comparisons and swaps work
- Differences in efficiency and strategy

---

## 🛠️ Built with
- **React:** To create a smooth, interactive experience.
